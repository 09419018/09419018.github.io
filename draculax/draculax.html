                                Dracula X is a platforming game with linear screens and different routes you can choose. You have three different paths you can take, with three different endings. Each stage has checkpoints between screens, so if you die, you start from the screen, but if you game over, you start from the beginning of the stage. You start with 3 lives, but you can get more during the game. There’s infinite continues. There’s a password system, where you can start with a desired weapon on a desired stage, but only with 10 hearts.

                                Annette and Maria are waiting for you to rescue them. They are held captive in different stages. To access them you need to take a specific route and a key to open their door. In stage 3 is where it’s determined which route you would like to take. You can get a bad ending, not saving them. The good ending, where you save Maria only, and the best ending where you save Annette and Maria.

If you fall down the pillars, you will end up in stage 4’ (the catacombs) and you won’t be able to save anyone.

                                Jumping is faster than walking. You have a long jump and a small jump. If you press the direction and jump, you will jump farther, but if you jump and then press the direction, you will do a small jump instead. To escape from enemies fast, jump away.

You can do a short or a higher backflip if you press jump twice faster or slower. You can cancel the slide animation after the backflip if you whip right before landing.

To cancel them, you have to whip right before landing on the ground. If you whip when you jump to a platform, Ritcher will fall faster than usual so you could miss and fall down.

You can only hold one sub weapon at a time. Each sub weapon has a powerful attack called item crash, which makes you invulnerable until the animation is over. If you pick up another sub weapon, it will be replaced but the old one will fall on the ground and you can pick it up again. If you don’t pick it up,  It will fade away after a while.

                                There’s infinite continues, and you can get extra lives in certain stages hidden in walls, or if you defeat bosses with full health. There’s a password system. You can start from a specific level and the desired weapon. If you die (or game over) and lose your weapon or the key, you can always reset the console  and introduce the password to recover the weapon you had on or the key, but you will have to start from the beginning of the level with only 10 hearts.

                                Enemies are  scripted, which means that they will always be in the same spot, but some of them, what they do is decided once you cross screens. Usually these enemies are the knight, and some others that move from left to right, like the skeletons. The bosses can be manipulated but some of them have a strong RNG.

                                There’s a boss at the end of each stage. You can see the boss HP bar under yours displayed in blue. Bosses do a desperation attack when their hp bar is empty. You can’t die from it, but you will take damage. You get a 1UP if you defeat the boss with full HP. You keep your hearts and sub weapon to the next stage. You might not get hit by a boss if the boss is on i-frames.

                                You can stand very far out on a platform, you can use this to make it up on platforms that are very far, or prevent you from falling from platforms when you get hit.

                                Candles can be a bait so if there’s candles, and probably platforms with edges too, enemies might spawn at that point, especially if there’s water under, mermaid spawns are the most common ones.

                                If you see a succession of platforms, it can be an indicator that enemies are going to spawn, especially if there’s water under. You can get close to the edge to trigger them and moonwalk back to make them go away. If you see that pattern of platforms on a screen, I recommend moving to the edge of it carefully to check if there’s enemies, and moonwalk back so they go away. This works very well against mermaids.

                                The moonwalk can also be used to reposition yourself while standing on small platforms,especially if there’s bats or medusa heads that you want them to be on the side you are facing.

                                Be careful with rotating platforms, if you land very close to the edge, even if you don’t jump on the rotating platform, it will start rotating already, so if you keep walking, you will fall down. If you land very close to rotating platforms, always step back just in case the platform got hit and rotates.

                                Sometimes it’s easier to damage boost past the enemies rather than killing them. .You can also jump over certain enemies. Preferably jump to run away from them once you dodge them since jumping is faster than walking.

                                which you can also find inside candles. Sub weapons are situational, they will make the stages much easier. Each sub weapon is different, they cost different amounts of hearts, and they have a powerful attack that consumes a higher amount of hearts, we refer to as the ‘’item crash’’. All item crashes make you invulnerable until the animation is over.

                                The more hearts you have, the faster you can use your sub weapon, making you shoot a lot of them uninterrupted. However, if you have less than 50 hearts, you will shoot less, which can cause whipping in between. The amount of whips between throwing the sub weapon will increase exponentially while the heart count is going down. If you have less than 20 hearts, you will be mostly whipping.

I will explain with more details each sub weapon, with their respective usage and item crash usage. I organized them from the least hearts that you require, to the one that requires the most, displaying the amount of hearts necessary for using them on the left, and the hearts required for the item crash on the right.  After this I will give you tips for enemies and which weapon is good against them in the ‘’enemies’’ section.

                                        The axe travels in an arc above you. It’s very useful to kill enemies that are in different platform levels, enemies above you and enemies that are in a weird angle that’s hard to hit with a whip. You can  also use it to reach candles that are higher than you, or hard to reach.

                                        The item crash is a circle of axes that clears weak enemies around you once the circle expands. Remember that It gives invulnerability until the animation is over, just like any other item crash.

                                        The knife is the fastest sub weapon. It clears weak enemies in a horizontal line in front of you. It’s very good against weak enemies that jump towards you, or deal damage to enemies that are far away and you can’t reach.

Remember they can only swing the spear at you once, so if they did, you can reset the screen if you go downstairs and back, then they will swing the spear again.

                                But if you are closer or farther down, they will fly towards your position.. You can almost despawn all the birds you encounter in the screen if you wait long enough and bait them towards your position at the very edge of the screen.

                                The axe is very good against the birds, since it can kill them before they wake up, and also they will always be above you.

                                You can stand at a distance without getting hit by the fire. You can kill the fireballs they shoot. Axe comes in handy when they are on other platform levels, or they are far away in an awkward spot.

                                When they’re carried by the bats, you want to throw axes as fast as you can. Keep calm and don’t stop walking. If they get behind you, jump quickly to leave them behind. The axe can reach them and use the item crash if you are surrounded.

                                The knife is very good against them when they are far away in front of you. Keep calm, don’t move too much and kill them one by one before scrolling the screen.
