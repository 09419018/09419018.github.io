                                Goof troop is an action-adventure video game. There are 5 levels composed of different screens or rooms, and the goal of the game is to open the boss door at the end of each level. To get to the goal, you have to look around the screens to find keys, solve puzzles, kill pirates, and make use of special tools until you find the key for the boss room, and a variety of other challenges like dark rooms and moving platforms! There are a lot of doors that you must open in order to progress and they open by doing all of these. Sometimes opening a door can be arranged by killing the pirates in that room, other times solving puzzles, pressing switches or using a key.

You will get a password after beating a stage. If you game over, you can enter the password to keep playing the last stage you were at.  You have all passwords at the end of this guide.

                                You can choose between two characters. Goofy, which is slow but stronger enough to kill all pirates in one hit, and Max, which is faster but much weaker so some of the pirates take two hits and also you get slower while carrying something in your arms. Them both can kill in one hit with a bomb.

                                The game has a simultaneous cooperative mode where a where a second player can join and play at the same time, and you can cooperate with him, catch their barrels to help kill the pirates and work together to beat puzzles and make it through other challenges together. If a second player joins, you can only carry 1 special tool per player, and you can respawn if one of you die, by crossing to a new screen and pressing the select button.

                                Although Goofy and Max cannot fight directly, they can use various methods to defeat enemies such as barrels, coconuts,  pots and bombs that you will find all over the screens, laying on the floor. Goofy and Max can lift their arms up to pick up these items. You can use other methods like kicking blocks towards the enemies, bomb them or bait them to their death.

                                There are blocks in this game that you need to kick in order to solve puzzles. You need to kick them into sockets to solve them. These can be used to kill enemies and they can collide with second player and break! Some blocks explode after a while after getting kicked, or they explode when they collide with an enemy or the other

                                There are special tools that can help the player to be used as a weapon to stun enemies, make bridges and zip lines to cross paths, or helping yourself through other challenges. You can find them laying on the floor. Once you pick up a special tool, it will be replaced by the old one and the old one will fall on the ground. You can hold up to 2 in single player, and only one per player as cooperative. You need to find these to progress in the game. If you want to switch special tools with the other player, you can take a death and both weapons will go to the player alive. Hover over the weapon you want to keep and the other weapon will be sent to the other player when this respawns. These special tools are mostly situational.

You start with 0 continues and 2 lives. You can get more hearts, lifes and continues picking up bonus items that are all over the stages, either laying on the floor, lifting pots or digging using a special tool. These can be fruits and diamonds. Each bonus item give you different things. Each player has its own hearts and lives, and continues are shared.They are displayed on top of the screen, but you can’t see the continues. If you have a lot of lifes, the bonus items might appear with less frequency under barrels or digging. You start with 2 lifes and 0 continues and you find the continues through the game.

Barrels and pots will be back, blocks will appear in the way you first found them, and enemies will be back on the same spot you encountered them for the first time. If you mess up a screen, you can go back and enter the room again so everything will be back to how it was. Bonus items such as lifes, hearts and continues that were laying on the floor won’t respawn.

                                        You can pick up barrels with the grapple so you can reach barrels and items that are very far away in your advantage. You can also pick up fruits and diamonds with the grapple.

If a screen is too long or another door is more convenient, crossthat door to spawn there in case you die.

                        <p><b>COOPERATIVE TIPS!</b></p>

                        <p>
                                Playing as cooperative has a lot of advantages since you have another player helping you solving puzzles and killing enemies! The differences between the characters is what makes the cooperative so good, because each player gets a rol during the game.
                        </p>

If you have your arms up almost at all times, you will make sure you catch any barrel your mate could throw at you, without needing to pay so much attention to what he is doing.

                                In general, I would use Max as the player that goes around the screen picking up keys and grapples to make it through the levels very fast, meanwhile Goofy is looking for your safety, baiting the pirates towards him, or killing them for you. Let goofy carry the bell at all times, and he could also hold the grapple to stun enemies and protect Max in the way.

                        <p>
                                You can use Max to go around and pick up barrels and throw them to Goofy since he deals more damage.

                                This room is also very complicated and many things can happen since the pirates can move as they please. Usually I move up so the red pirate comes over there and picks up the upper pot, and I use it to hit the bottom fat pirate. At the same time, the rolling pirate that’s on the upper right side of the screen will most likely kick a block to the left. I use one of the pots in front of the blocks to hit the last blow on the bottom fat pirate. Then you can probably kill the upper pirate by kicking the block, and move around to pick up pots from where you can to kill the red pirate. Be very careful and pay attention to see if he will catch the pot! Finally pick up the yellow key and pick up the stairs to the right.

                        boomerangs towards your position and they will land in place, and the blue one will shoot two boomerangs that bounce all over the walls until they fall down on the floor at some point. You want to kill the blue skeleton first. Play around the left side so the red skeleton throws the boomerang that way, and focus on hitting the blue skeleton once this one lands. If the skeleton is jumping, you won’t be able to hit it until it lands on the floor.

At some point when the skeleton is 6 hits left, it will remove its head and throw it against you. This one will follow you for a while, but it will go back to its body if you hit the head with a boomerang, so the ideal here would be keeping the boomerang until the skeleton makes a move to save the boomerang in case the skeleton throws its head so you can hit it right away.

Then lift your arms again and carefully go around until you can get some barrels to kill the left pirate. Finally, hold your hands up and catch possible barrels from the last pirate and kill it.

                                There’s two larvaes that take 6 hits each. Right when the fight starts, wait until the larva is gone and  get to the first horizontal trunk and wait there. After the screen shakes, stalactites will fall down. Be careful and move left and right to dodge them. You can see where they are going to fall by the shadow. After all the stalactites fall to the trunks, get on the tiny bottom middle trunk and wait there. When the larvas come across the trunk in front of you, wait and throw the stalactite in its head. Then move to the middle of the trunk again and repeat this over and over. Sometimes the larva can appear in the vertical trunk, so just get close to it and hit the head when it comes closer.

                                Here is where the complicated puzzle is located. In this puzzle you have both normal blocks and blocks that explode after a while. The red blocks explode very fast, the yellow blocks explode fast, and the green blocks takes a long time until they explode. The point here is to move the blocks in a way that you have time enough to finish the puzzle, because you need to put a few exploding blocks on the left side to be

                                This is another puzzle that works with the exploding blocks. You can throw the barrels from the right side to kill the pirate. You need the left side barrels to complete the puzzle. Kick the blocks in the correct order following the arrows.

The pirates will start throwing barrels so catch one of them, dodging possible barrels thrown at you at the same time and throw it at the middle pirate. Then pick up one of the barrels in front of it and kill the pirate. Lift your arms again and carefully go around the isle until you can get some barrels to kill the pirate that is on the left side of the screen. Finally, hold your hands up and catch possible barrels from the last pirate. Remember that the pirate can catch your barrel and throw it back at you, so be ready with your hands up all the time you can!

Once you are in the mine cart, you are  invulnerable and the cart kills all the enemies that runs over them. Pick up the upper cart and direct it towards the right on the upper side. It will kill the red pirate and you can get out of the cart by pressing diagonal down until you get pushed out of the cart and exit the room to the right.
