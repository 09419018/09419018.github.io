                I recommend playing the US version since weapons are faster and there’s less enemies spawns. The continue is also on the main screen so you don’t need to use a tedious code. Unfortunately Satan takes more hits to die.

                    Ghosts ‘n goblins is a platforming game where you control Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons.. to rescue Princess Prin-Prin, who has been kidnapped by Astaroth, the king of the Demon World.

                <p>
                    If you get hit, you will lose your armor, and if you get hit again, you will die. You can find armor (and other items and weapons) if you find the invisible triggers all over the stages.

                    There are 6 stages with checkpoints and bosses, and to get the good ending you have to beat the game twice. You can keep playing the game infinitely, but it becomes harder each time. In loop 2, You need to beat level 6 with the shield weapon, or you will get sent back to level 5 after killing satan.

                    There’s internal rank, which means the game becomes harder the longer you survive, and increases every loop. It affects enemies spawns, speed and amount of projectiles. The enemies are both RNG and fixed.

                    There’s a timer on the screen, so if the timer runs out, you die, but fortunately, there’s items hidden in the stages that will give you extra time, but there’s also others that will reduce your timer! The timer will restart once you go to another stage.

                    You can pick a variety of weapons, but most of the weapons are terrible and are meant to troll you. Once you pick up a weapon, the weapon you were holding will disappear. You can recover weapons if you kill enemies that carry pots, or they are laying in specific stages or if you cross an invisible trigger to make them appear.

                    There’s continues in this game, but there are a few regional differences and in theory, you can ‘’only continue’’ in the US version. In the japanese version you can continue but only if you introduce a cheat code.

                    Arthur jump is a fixed arc, which means that once you jump, you can’t switch direction or height, you are locked in the jump until you reach the ground. Before jumping, always make sure you wait and kill the enemies that spawn before starting a jump.

                    You can turn around while ducking to shoot that way. You can also turn around in the middle of a jump, so you can shoot both directions.

                    Walking is faster than jumping, so try to jump the least possible and only when it’s necessary. I recommend shooting before jumping, so it might kill some enemies. Always wait when you are about to jump over something, to kill spawns first before jumping

                    Arremers dodge your attacks unless they are already doing an action. You can shoot one dagger while being really close to the arremer, and jump towards it while shooting more daggers. This will always hit, the arremer can’t dodge it since it’s already moving. Then wait until the arremer swings down to attack it again, and repeat it

                    The torch could be an option to play this game if you will. To kill the arremer is very similar to the dagger. Shoot the arremer very close and jump towards it while shooting another one. Then wait until it swings down and shoot two more, but don’t spam the attack because if the torch falls to the ground, you won’t be able to shoot anymore until the fire on the ground stops

                    Duck right away when you see the enemies. Their arc increases more over time when they are on the screen, so you won’t get hit. If they are too low, you can walk to reposition in between them and duck.

                    The next section is the pigs hotel. There’s no more checkpoints in this stage, and it’s a very long one, because after the hotel there’s a platform section. There’s two ways to make it past the hotel: the normal way, and the hotel skip.

                    The pigs will throw balls at you if you are in front of them, and down if you are under them. If you shoot them, they won’t throw balls at you, that’s why the dagger is good in here, because it shoots very fast.  You can kite the enemies by shooting and jumping away. You can jump over them and kite, so you don’t have to kill them to make it to the closest ladder.

                    There isn’t a strategy to move the pigs away from ladders when you are trying to climb. You just need to wait and get lucky that they will move away.

                    Get close to the arremer and shoot at it so it moves up. Keep walking until the end of the wall, and jump to the arremer and get hit by it while facing right. Once inside the wall, keep jumping until you reach the third floor. Then walk out and keep walking without stopping. Then keep climbing quickly. It's a hard trick.

                    This is the only arremer we can’t skip. Climb to the top of the ladder to wake it up, and then try to kill it when it swings at you like we killed it in the other levels.

                    Since there’s an arremer on the left, climbing up the ladder while the pig is on the right is good to prevent waking the arremer up by accident while hitting the pig. There will be random burrito spawns all over the stage so be careful before climbing ladders.

                    There will be an axe in the way. Jump over it because as we said, if you don’t have the shield, you will get sent back to level 5 after beating this stage. If you pick it up by accident, you can kill yourself and restart the stage, since you can find one where the dragon rest, as I showed before.

                    We will face two satans this time, wake up one at a time, leaving the other offscreen so it won’t wake up yet. You can always duck under satan. Standing close baits its projectile towards you, but you can also kill the projectile with the shield. When it swings towards you, jump to the other side while hitting it as many times as possible, and ducking once it gets very close to you. Once you kill the first one, you can walk towards the second one to wake it up and fight it the exact same way.

                    There’s a quick kill of both satans at the same time. You have to wake them up fast enough and kill the projectile, and once they move to the left, you can walk right to the end of the wall and shoot towards them in that position. They won’t reach you and they will be both dead in no time.
