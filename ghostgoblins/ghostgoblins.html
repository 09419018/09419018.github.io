                I recommend playing the US version since weapons are faster and there’s less enemies spawns. The continue is also on the main screen so you don’t need to use a tedious code. Unfortunately Satan takes more hits to die.

                    Ghosts ‘n goblins is a platforming game where you control Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons.. to rescue Princess Prin-Prin, who has been kidnapped by Astaroth, the king of the Demon World.

                <p>
                    If you get hit, you will lose your armor, and if you get hit again, you will die. You can find armor (and other items and weapons) if you find the invisible triggers all over the stages.

                    There are 6 stages with checkpoints and bosses, and to get the good ending you have to beat the game twice. You can keep playing the game infinitely, but it becomes harder each time. In loop 2, You need to beat level 6 with the shield weapon, or you will get sent back to level 5 after killing satan.

                    You can pick a variety of weapons, but most of the weapons are terrible and are meant to troll you. Once you pick up a weapon, the weapon you were holding will disappear.

        </p>

        <div class="space"></div>

            <p>These are cheat codes so you can continue in the japanese version, a stage select in case you want to learn a specific stage or if you didn't click continue by accident in the title screen. Then we have the game genie codes, which modify the playthrough giving us advantages like invincibility, but they don't work in the original cartridge. Use these with moderation!</p>

            <p><b>CONTINUE</b></p>

            <div class="space2"></div>

            <p>
                In the japanese version, you don’t have a continue in the title screen when you die, but you can continue where you last died if you hold 🡺, and press B B B, and press START. (All of these while holding right, in the title screen)
            </p>

            <div class="space2"></div>

            <p><b>STAGE SELECT</b></p>

            <div class="space2"></div>
        
            <p>
                At the title screen, hold 🡺 and press B B B, release the right button and enter 🡹 B B B 🡸 B B B 🡻 B B B and press START. (Note that you only have to hold right in the first code we enter, not the rest of the codes with the other directions). 
            </p>

            <p>
                You will see the stage select screen, use A to advance levels and B to rewind the levels. Press START to begin a level. Once you finish the level, you will be asked which level you want to play next. You can choose stage 7, you will begin with the lance, but you will be able to defeat Astaroth with it. You can select stage 7 two times to witness the true ending of the game.

            <p><b>SECRET MESSAGE</b></p>

            <div class="space2"></div>

            <p>
                In order to see this message, you must defeat Astaroth twice and see the real ending of the game. At the second screen of the ending, enter A B 🡹 🡻 A B 🡸 🡺. If you did it right, you will see some credits.

                    Walking is faster than jumping, so try to jump the least possible and only when it’s necessary. I recommend shooting before jumping, so it might kill some enemies. Always wait when you are about to jump over something, to kill spawns first before jumping

                    We’re going to farm the dagger, because it’s easy to use, and fast.  You will need to keep killing zombies for a long time, and picking up everything they drop, until they drop the dagger. All bosses are immune to some weapon, we will review it later.

                    Arremers dodge your attacks unless they are already doing an action. You can shoot one dagger while being really close to the arremer, and jump towards it while shooting more daggers. This will always hit, the arremer can’t dodge it since it’s already moving. Then wait until the arremer swings down to attack it again, and repeat it

                    The torch could be an option to play this game if you will. To kill the arremer is very similar to the dagger. Shoot the arremer very close and jump towards it while shooting another one.

                    The pigs will throw balls at you if you are in front of them, and down if you are under them. If you shoot them, they won’t throw balls at you, that’s why the dagger is good in here, because it shoots very fast.  You can kite the enemies by shooting and jumping away. You can jump over them and kite, so you don’t have to kill them to make it to the closest ladder.
