                    Parodius is a shoot 'em up arcade video game and the second title in the Parodius series produced by Konami. It was released in 1990 in Japan, followed by Europe. They ported it to Super Nintendo in 1992. The European version is known as Parodius - Non sense fantasy.

                    It's supposed to be a Gradius parody. The title of the arcade is called "From myth to laughter", a play on gradius III subtitle. 
                    With a really japanese humor,  all  of  the Gradius elements are  modified to make them look funny. The Big core, given a neon casino look, or the spider boss, turned into a dancer!

            The soundtrack or Parodius consist of classical music, remade into a more arcade electronic way, and also songs of the Gradius game. This game is perfect for beginners that just started with the shoot em up genre, but it still proves a challenge for higher levels like 1CC. The game has infinite continues. However, by default, they only provide you with three lifes, that is why 1CC is much harder than in Gradius. The game is quite long, but it doesn’t require as much stamina as other games, due to the great weapon selection and its coverage, so it’s a perfect balance. In general it is easy to recover except a few checkpoints, but they grant you will bells so you stand a chance. The curve of difficulty is insane, it goes from really easy, to completely impossible due to the internal rank system, but taking a dead lower the ranks drastically, so the game is fairly beatable. The game feels pretty balanced (for example one speed is enough to make it past almost the entire game). The character roaster is much more simple and straightforward, but unfortunately, you can’t choose custom weapon upgrades like in Gradius. The music is really funny and incredibly well done. The game lags quite a bit if you play with all the upgrades, but it doesn’t feel so bad. Personally, I love this game, they found the perfect balance. It’s a fiesta game, full of joy, fun bosses, great music and unexpected situations! Let's get started!

            This game is a horizontal shoot 'em up. It has four different characters that you can pick, but the weapon selection is limited to its character. You can get the weapons by upgrading your ship with power ups that you will find by killing specific enemies. You can also find bells if you kill specific enemies, which grants you with different special attacks. This game has an internal rank, which means that the longer you survive, the harder the game gets. Enemies will shoot faster and more projectiles, but if you die, the internal rank will drop drastically, so the game will come back to the standard difficulty.

                    Twin bee, in my opinion, is the easiest character to play due to it’s incredible DPS that rocket holds, and the good coverage for the top and the bottom of the screen, that three way grants you, together with the options that tracks your movement. Only by staying in the middle of the screen and making some circles to spread the bullets with the options will guarantee success through almost any stage. Also it’s shield is pretty generous, it's pretty wide and can take a lot of hits before it’s destroyed.
                    Tail gun will be useful in many checkpoints if you die and lose all your upgrades, so it’s also a good backup that this character gives to beginner players.

                    The point is to have the least things on screen possible. The enemies will appear on the right side of the screen and shoot projectiles towards your current position, so the idea is to get rid of them before they stand a chance against you.  We will use everything we have to try to kill the enemies immediately when they show up on screen, and if they manage to shoot, bait the projectiles to one side, and move to another, or reduce the speed and frequency of the projectiles. I will show you all the tools available that you can use to your advantage to be a professional in shoot em ups in no time!

                <p>
                    The position of your ship is very important to dodge and attack. Always focus on killing rather than dodging.

                    the right middle side of the screen. This will allow you to kill the enemies and spawns fast enough to not make it into the screen. You have to play very aggressively, but if you don’t know the game well enough, you can start playing around the middle of the screen until you learn the game.

                    Never get behind, don’t stand at the left edge of the screen for too long. All the bullets will aim at that position and you won’t be able to make it past.

                One speed is enough to complete the game, except for a few stages. I recommend only one speed if you are not an experienced player. Use two speeds if you are comfortable with it, especially in stages with a lot of bullets so you can have more time to dodge, or special stages that requires more than one speed

                    The enemies will shoot projectiles towards your current position. Wait in a spot that you consider safe, until you see the enemies shoot, to bait the projectiles to that spot, and then move to some other side. Take advantage of the little time between one bullet and the next one, to move or kill the enemies that are in spots that are hard to reach.

                    To dodge, position yourself as far as where the projectiles come from. Stand in an empty and safe spot, far away from the projectile’s origin. Bait the  projectiles to that side and tap slightly around it to have more room to dodge others, and move to the other side where the projectiles came from.

                    I made a strategy which I call back and forth, which is moving forward to bait the projectiles to the front side, and then move back to avoid all of them and at the same time kill all the enemies on the screen. Repeating this over and over while also making circles is one of the most  successful strategies

                    If you don’t have upgrades, or the screen is crowded, focus on playing on the top or bottom of the screen. The furthest you can from the projectile's origin. You can help yourself with tailgun to kill the enemies that appear behind you, to empty the whole path.

                    Having the correct weapon selection and knowing how to use it is crucial to beat the level in the easiest way possible. Get more speed if the stage has a lot of empty space and there are a lot of enemies and bullets. To open paths easily and deal a lot of damage, use rocket. I recommend recovering the rocket first. If it is a stage that has enemies on top and bottom of the screen, choose three way. Three way is going to be the main build. If there

                   Be careful while picking power ups, it could be a bait to run into an enemy, or it will distract you enough to lead you to your doom. Don’t hurry and let the power up reach your position by the scroll of the screen.

                    Shield increases the rank considerably. You can wait in the shield highlight without using it, until a bullet reaches your position, and then use it. Like this we won’t increase the rank, but we could take a bullet in case of an emergency. Play with the shield on and have another highlight on the power up bar where the shield is, so if you get hit, you can recover it

They will most likely bait you into an enemy, or distract you enough to make mistakes too. Also it will increase the rank a lot, so picking a bell will be situational. I will show you how to properly use the bells to get the most out of them.Usually we are going to aim for the blue bell before bosses or if we die in a checkpoint and we are stuck, because it is easier to hit the bell and get the one we want if we don’t have any upgrades.

You can also take an intentional death to switch an unwanted weapon or so. Usually dying in the space areas is fine to switch weapons or lower the rank. As we saw, not picking up bells and saving the shield for the best moment will decrease the rank considerably.

                    Increasing the amount of things on screen makes the game lag, you can use this to your advantage to play the game slower if you have a lot of upgrades and you shoot constantly. Also the other way around, if you want to have a smoother experience.

                    Another interesting thing that I observed in the game, is that if you are standing too far away from an enemy, the enemy angle won’t cover you, so it will shoot a bullet to the direction you are at, but not so precise. We could make the enemies shoot straight or manipulate the projectiles this way.

                    The normal way to play the zig zag is by standing to the left edge of the screen, waiting for the green bubbles to appear. This will make the blue enemies shoot to the front so you can avoid them and kill them easily at the same time from there. Wait until the bubbles cross each other around the left, moving slightly to avoid all the projectiles incoming and also paying attention to kill the green bubbles that went in front of you. Be really careful with these green bubbles in front of you, if you didn’t manage to kill them be careful of the projectiles they shoot.

                    The easiest way to kill this boss if you don’t have any upgrades is to die over and over to farm a blue bell in the checkpoint before the boss. We are going to position in between the umbrellas, at point blank, trying to deal as much damage as we can. Whenever the umbrellas starts moving towards you, and both skeletons are in the middle of the screen, use the bomb and sneak in between the two skeletons to not get hit by the bones. Unfortunately for us, the bomb doesn’t clear the bones and you will die if you touch them.
