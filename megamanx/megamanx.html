            Megaman X is an action platform video game where you have different stages that you can Freely pick. Your character evolves and becomes stronger by defeating bosses and finding secret powerups hidden all over the stages. After beating all bosses, you will go to the enemy castle, Sigma, where you will need to defeat all the bosses once again, fight against new sigmaâ€™s allies  and confront him in a final battle.

                    Thereâ€™s different stages that you can pick freely.  Each stage has checkpoints, hidden power ups, and a boss. Once you defeat the boss, you will learn its ability as a sub weapon. Other bosses are vulnerable to these sub weapons, so the point is to defeat the bosses in an order that you can use the weapon theyâ€™re weak at.

                    Thereâ€™s three kinds of <b>POWER UPS</b> you can find all over the stages. These are not required to beat the game. You can keep the power ups even if you donâ€™t beat the boss.

                    These improve your armor. They will give you new skills,  like dash, defense, better buster and a helmet. These will make a huge difference in the game, giving you a lot of advantage, and theyâ€™re required to find other power ups.

Once you use it, it will become completely empty. You can refill the sub tanks killing enemies and picking up the energy  they drop.

                    Once you get the arm upgrade, you can charge the sub weapon while holding the attack button while holding a sub weapon, until megaman becomes pink. Each sub weapon charged does a different ability and itâ€™s much stronger.  Some are required to pick up certain power ups.

                    If you collect every single powerup in the game, and defeat all the bosses, , you can unlock the most powerful weapon of the game, the hadouken, which kills everything in one hit. Itâ€™s the same as the hadouken in street fighter.

You can move back and forth to spawn the enemies again, to farm energy or energy weapon. They have different drop rates, but in general, small enemies drop more often.

The new bosses are also vulnerable to sub weapons,  but you wonâ€™t get any new sub weapon out of them. Sometimes they can have two vulnerabilities. Sigma is ONLY vulnerable to r. shield

                    The game has lifes, and infinite continues. You can have a max. of 9 lives. Once you die, you will respawn at the checkpoint. If you run out of lifes, you will have to try the entire level again. As I said, you still keep all the power ups you found through the stage. You can find lifes laying down in stages, or you can get them from killing certain enemies.  The lives you find laying in stages will respawn

                    Enemies drop energy and weapon energy. They respawn if you leave them offscreen, so you can abuse this to get more energy. I recommend getting as many lives as possible, and always fill all the sub tanks before the stages.

            Once you defeat a  boss, you will learn his ability and you can use it as a sub weapon that consumes energy weapon. Other bosses are weak to these abilities, which means that you will deal extra damage and you will be able to stun them or else. You will notice if the boss is weak to a sub weapon because it will do a special animation or it will blink. You can refill energy weapon from enemy drops. Above you can find all the weapons you get from the boss, and the second picture (in red) are the bosses weaknesses.

                <p>
                    I highly recommend trying to beat the stage, defeating the chameleon, because the chameleon sub weapon charged with the arm upgrade  gives you invincibility for a short amount of time. This is incredibly strong, giving you a lot of advantage through the game.  If you canâ€™t defeat the chameleon, donâ€™t worry and come back to beat the stage at the end of the route.I will give you tips to beat this stage right now with our current weapons

                    Once it approaches you with its tongue, it will always fall down. If you are too close to the boss, it will reach you with its tongue, so stay far away and wait for its next move.

                <p>
                    I recommend beating it early in the game to get its sub weapon. You could make an attempt in between every stage Once you have more power ups. And if you really canâ€™t beat it, wait until the end and go to stage 8 sting chameleon in the route guide.

                    Once it appears, green lines will appear. The spider will fall down, following the first green line that it encounters, and it will keep falling through the next line it encounters until it reaches the very end. The way the green lines appear is random, thereâ€™s no guaranteed pattern.

                    The spider falls very fast, but thereâ€™s a trick you can use. Once you see the lines, follow them a little bit with your eyes and pause. Like this you have more time to keep following the lines with your eyes until you acknowledge the route it will take, so you can reposition to not get hit, and also get close to guarantee the hit.

                    The spider can drop tiny spiders at the very beginning. You can charge the buster before crossing the door to kill them. Move slightly to the right to not get hit by the first one, and jump over it when it comes towards you. Like this you guarantee that you have full health for the hadouken.

                    If you fail the hadouken, try to kill it with the ice. Donâ€™t use a sub tank to try the hadouken again, because if you fail you will be left with no energy, and this boss is very hard. When the boss has half HP, it will fall even faster.

                    Another easier option for this fight is using homing and just try to dodge its movement. Homing is not its weakness

                    With rolling shield charged on, you can camp in those holes on the wall to refill the tanks and get energy for the weapons. Remember you canâ€™t switch weapons when having the shield on, so before the fight, when you are ready, switch to the buster on the pause menu.

                    The first fight is against sigmaâ€™s dog. The fight always starts the same way. When it becomes full HP, it will jump over you and come back. Just wait until itâ€™s back on the ground to do a hadouken.

                    If you don't succeed, the dogâ€™s weakness is the s. ice. I suggest standing away from it. You will make it jump towards you. Then is when you can dash under and hope you donâ€™t eat many hits.

                    The second fight is against sigma with the sword. This fight always starts the same way too. After he gets full HP, he will dash towards you. Do a hadouken right when his HP is full.

                    If you don't succeed, climb to the top of the left wall and stay there. When sigma bounces to the left wall for the 3rd time, slide down a little bit and shoot e. spark. Like this you will bait him down and he wonâ€™t be able to reach you.

                    Then the final battle. We will fight Sigma, who has become a big dog robot. The only way to kill it is using rolling shield on its head. You canâ€™t deal damage with any other weapon. It will shoot fire through its mouth, and shoot electrical balls. There will be two claws that move around that shoot lasers.You wonâ€™t get hit by the things he throws if you stand on the claw. I will show you how to play and then easy strategies for this.

                    The best way to attack it, will be standing on the claw, jumping in circles towards the face and back to the platform.

                    To get to the claw you can either wait until it moves towards you, but itâ€™s not so frequent.
