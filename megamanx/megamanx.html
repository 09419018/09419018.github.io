            Megaman X is an action platform video game where you have different stages that you can Freely pick. Your character evolves and becomes stronger by defeating bosses and finding secret powerups hidden all over the stages. After beating all bosses, you will go to the enemy castle, Sigma, where you will need to defeat all the bosses once again, fight against new sigmaâ€™s allies  and confront him in a final battle.

                    Thereâ€™s different stages that you can pick freely.  Each stage has checkpoints, hidden power ups, and a boss. Once you defeat the boss, you will learn its ability as a sub weapon. Other bosses are vulnerable to these sub weapons, so the point is to defeat the bosses in an order that you can use the weapon theyâ€™re weak at.

                    Thereâ€™s three kinds of <b>POWER UPS</b> you can find all over the stages. These are not required to beat the game. You can keep the power ups even if you donâ€™t beat the boss.

                    These improve your armor. They will give you new skills,  like dash, defense, better buster and a helmet. These will make a huge difference in the game, giving you a lot of advantage, and theyâ€™re required to find other power ups.

Once you use it, it will become completely empty. You can refill the sub tanks killing enemies and picking up the energy  they drop.

                    Once you get the arm upgrade, you can charge the sub weapon while holding the attack button while holding a sub weapon, until megaman becomes pink. Each sub weapon charged does a different ability and itâ€™s much stronger.  Some are required to pick up certain power ups.

The new bosses are also vulnerable to sub weapons,  but you wonâ€™t get any new sub weapon out of them. Sometimes they can have two vulnerabilities. Sigma is ONLY vulnerable to r. shield

If you run out of lifes, you will have to try the entire level again. As I said, you still keep all the power ups you found through the stage. You can find lifes laying down in stages, or you can get them from killing certain enemies.  The lives you find laying in stages will respawn

                    Enemies drop energy and weapon energy. They respawn if you leave them offscreen, so you can abuse this to get more energy. I recommend getting as many lives as possible, and always fill all the sub tanks before the stages.

            Once you defeat a  boss, you will learn his ability and you can use it as a sub weapon that consumes energy weapon. Other bosses are weak to these abilities, which means that you will deal extra damage and you will be able to stun them or else. You will notice if the boss is weak to a sub weapon because it will do a special animation or it will blink. You can refill energy weapon from enemy drops. Above you can find all the weapons you get from the boss, and the second picture (in red) are the bosses weaknesses.

                    I highly recommend trying to beat the stage, defeating the chameleon, because the chameleon sub weapon charged with the arm upgrade  gives you invincibility for a short amount of time. This is incredibly strong, giving you a lot of advantage through the game.  If you canâ€™t defeat the chameleon, donâ€™t worry and come back to beat the stage at the end of the route.I will give you tips to beat this stage right now with our current weapons
