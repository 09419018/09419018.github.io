                <p>
                    We are going to pick up the armor upgrade at the chameleon stage right away since it gives you 50% of the damage reduction. You don’t need to beat the stage to keep it
                </p>

                    To find the armor upgrade you need the dash, and you have to climb up that green wall. You will encounter a mini boss.

                    And it tries to grab you with his arm. Just climb the wall. After a while when it is low hp, it will have smoke on its head, and it can grab the wall, moving towards it. Just dash jump over.

                    After defeating the miniboss you will get the armor upgrade, which reduces damage in 50%.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I highly recommend trying to beat the stage, defeating the chameleon, because the chameleon sub weapon charged with the arm upgrade  gives you invincibility for a short amount of time. This is incredibly strong, giving you a lot of advantage through the game.  If you can’t defeat the chameleon, don’t worry and come back to beat the stage at the end of the route.I will give you tips to beat this stage right now with our current weapons

                    The plan is to move to the middle to bait its attack towards you, and dash away from it and shoot so you don’t get hit and you land a shot. And repeat this over and over.

                    Once it approaches you with its tongue, it will always fall down. If you are too close to the boss, it will reach you with its tongue, so stay far away and wait for its next move.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I recommend beating it early in the game to get its sub weapon. You could make an attempt in between every stage Once you have more power ups. And if you really can’t beat it, wait until the end and go to stage 8 sting chameleon in the route guide.

                    Once it appears, green lines will appear. The spider will fall down, following the first green line that it encounters, and it will keep falling through the next line it encounters until it reaches the very end. The way the green lines appear is random, there’s no guaranteed pattern.

                    The spider falls very fast, but there’s a trick you can use. Once you see the lines, follow them a little bit with your eyes and pause. Like this you have more time to keep following the lines with your eyes until you acknowledge the route it will take, so you can reposition to not get hit, and also get close to guarantee the hit.

                    The spider can drop tiny spiders at the very beginning. You can charge the buster before crossing the door to kill them. Move slightly to the right to not get hit by the first one, and jump over it when it comes towards you. Like this you guarantee that you have full health for the hadouken.

                <p>
                    If you fail the hadouken, try to kill it with the ice. Don’t use a sub tank to try the hadouken again, because if you fail you will be left with no energy, and this boss is very hard. When the boss has half HP, it will fall even faster.
